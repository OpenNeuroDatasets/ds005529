This data set contains CBF, ATT and blood-brain barrier (BBB) kw (water exchange rate) acquired using DP-pCASL technique from 186 cognitively normal participant with age 8-92 years. 

For details about the age-related patterns of perfusion and BBB function changes in healthy populations, please refer to our eLife paper:
